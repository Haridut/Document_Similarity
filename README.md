# Document_Similarity
The code helps detect similar documents through TF-IDF vector with different distance metrics and it also tries using PCA (dimensionality reduction) to find similar documents.
Input : Many documents (this case considers one document per line and hence only one file is required)
Output: Five most similar documents by Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, Supremum distance, Cosine similarity and also after dimension reduction through PCA.
